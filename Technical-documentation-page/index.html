        <p>Probability is a branch of mathematics and statistics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur. This number is often expressed as a percentage (%), ranging from 0% to 100%.</p>
        <p>These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. </p>

        <header>Discrete Mathematical Structures</header>
        <p>Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" (in a way analogous to discrete variables, having a bijection with the set of natural numbers) rather than "continuous" (analogously to continuous functions). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic. By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as real numbers, calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics".</p>

        <p>
        Computer Organization and Architecture refers to the study of the internal workings, structure, and design of computer systems. It encompasses the design of processors (CPU), memory hierarchies, input/output systems, and how instructions are executed at the hardware level. Key concepts include instruction set architecture (ISA), pipelining, caching, and parallel processing. Understanding these principles is crucial for optimizing performance, improving energy efficiency, and developing new computing technologies, from embedded systems to supercomputers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern advancements in computer architecture focus on overcoming challenges like Mooreâ€™s Law limitations, power consumption, and the need for specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs for AI and TPUs for machine learning). Emerging trends include quantum computing, neuromorphic architectures, and heterogeneous computing systems that combine CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Knowledge of computer organization is essential for software developers, hardware engineers, and system designers to create efficient and scalable solutions in fields like cybersecurity, cloud computing, and real-time systems.
